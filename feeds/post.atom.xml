a non-technical person should take when they come up with ideas and want to
do something with them. I always appreciate these requests since it
provides recognition that I have some insight into software development
in the entrepreneurship and small business space. This is my first attempt to
describe in a blog post what I usually tell people who ask me what a
non-technical person should learn to better understand what they need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an overwhelming amount of information in the areas of
entrepreneurship and software development (and the intersection of them).
It's important to get a grasp on an &amp;quot;outline&amp;quot; of what you need to know before
diving in. That way you don't drown in a sea of endless information.&lt;/p&gt;
