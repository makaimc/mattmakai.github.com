          Welcome to my blog on<br/>software development.
          <br/><br/>
          I currently live in Washington, D.C. although I just finished
          <a href="http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/">traveling through 30 cities</a> 
          in the United States from March through August this year.
          <br/><br/>
          
          I develop software for<br/>
          <a href="http://www.excella.com/">Excella Consulting</a><br/>
          clients on-site and remotely.

<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3><a class="reference external" href="../static/presentations/dc-cont-intg-delivery-devops-service.html">DevOps Deployments-as-a-Service</a></h3>
<p>What are the best software-as-a-service platforms for building and deploying
your code? How can they help you quickly get a project off the ground and
sustain best practices as your codebase continues to scale? This talk
answers these questions and more by introducing you to services such as
Circle CI, Travis CI, factor.io, Code Climate, and many others, which take
the burden off setting up the infrastructure yourself. The talk will
balance out the discussion with the downsides to these platforms and
ways to avoid being locked in to declining providers.</p>
<p>Upcoming presentation to
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-integration/events/127362992/">DC Continuous Integration, Delivery, &amp; Deployment</a> on September 25th in Arlington, VA.</p>

<h3><a class="reference external" href="../static/presentations/djangocon-2013.html">DjangoCon 2013: Making Django Play Nice With Third Party Services</a></h3>
<p>Modern Django projects combine custom apps with third party services,
such as Twilio and Stripe, to create a complete product. Choosing the
right services for your application can make or break its usefulness to
users as well as your sanity during maintenance. This talk will show you
how to properly evaluate, integrate, and maximize what you get out of
SaaS products in your Django projects.</p>
<p>Talk given at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangocon.us/schedule/">DjangoCon US</a> on
September 5th at 10am in Chicago, IL. There are

<h3><a class="reference external" href="../static/presentations/django-boston-july-2013.html">Staying Sane While Taking Over An Existing Django Codebase</a></h3>
<p>How do you quickly get up to speed on an existing Django project codebase?
You're eventually going to run into a large unfamiliar codebase whether
you're the new developer on a team with an established codebase
or just working with code you wrote awhile back. This talk covers steps you
absolutely must take to identify and triage existing issues, stablize the
codebase, and gently guide the project towards &quot;this is amazing!&quot; status.</p>

<h3><a class="reference external" href="../static/presentations/omaha-python-july-2013.html">Making Your City's Developer Community Awesome</a></h3>
<p>What differentiates tech communities in cities across the United States?
How do you make your community rally around a programming language's
ecosystem and spur genuine excitement every time your group meets? This
talk will show you what the best tech communities do right (hint: it's not
city size that matters), what mistakes they need to correct, and how Omaha
can continue building momentum for its developer community.</p>
<p>Talk given at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.omahapython.org/blog/">Omaha Python</a> on July 1st. Unfortunately,

<h3><a class="reference external" href="../static/presentations/memphis-python-github-workflows.html">Git and Github Workflows</a></h3>
<p>What are the strengths and weaknesses of using Github for varying
development team configurations? This talk will cover topics such as
creating a canonical repository to have development team members fork
from, handling code reviews through pull requests, and creating separate
branches for testing and production deployments. This programming
language-agnostic talk draws upon work with both co-located and
geographically dispersed teams at the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, the George Washington University, and Motley Fool, some of which
was recently covered in this
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/01/hack-the-government/">article by Wired</a>.</p>
