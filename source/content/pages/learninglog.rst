Github recommends including a 
`contributing guide <https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines>`_ 
for open source projects by keeping a CONTRIBUTING.md file in the base 
directory of a repository. Having a CONTRIBUTING or CONTRIBUTING.md file 
will add an alert box that points to file when a user opens a pull request
or issue.
