* `Puppet <https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet>`_ can be used locally with
  the "puppet apply" command to set up a local system without a Puppet master
  running remotely.

* From the upcoming `Lean Analytics book <http://leananalyticsbook.com/>`_, 
  "Whenever you look at a metric, ask yourself, 'what will I do differently 
  based on this information?' If you can’t answer that question, you 
  probably shouldn’t worry about the metric too much." It's easy to overwhelm
  yourself with metrics but unless there is a clear metric -> action path,
  it's very unlikely that it is worth paying attention to.

* In vim, use this setting to copy & paste into the window without screwing
  up the formatting:

* Github recommends including a 
  `contributing guide <https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines>`_ 
  for open source projects by keeping a CONTRIBUTING.md file in the base 
  directory of a repository. Having a CONTRIBUTING or CONTRIBUTING.md file 
  will add an alert box that points to file when a user opens a pull request
  or issue.
