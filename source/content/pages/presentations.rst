2014 Talks
----------

Creating a Web App Around Existing Statsmodels Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How do you build and deploy a web application for a project that uses the 
`Statsmodels <https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/>`_ library? 
This talk will step through how to use the Python web application framework 
Flask to wrap a simple web application around existing Statsmodels code. You'll
then learn how to deploy the project to remote servers so it is accessible
through the Web.

Upcoming talk to 
`Statistical Programming DC <http://www.meetup.com/stats-prog-dc/>`_ 
in Washington, D.C. (exact May date TBD).

----


`Hacking Your Build Process with Ansible </presentations/2014-hacking-build-process-ansible.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What're the most fun and useful build hacks you can do with Ansible? You'll 
find out during this talk how to receive an SMS alert during lunch if 
something goes wrong with your latest build, hook your build pipeline into 
analytics infrastructure such as New Relic, and automate build status phone 
calls to micromanaging bosses. You'll learn how a few extra lines of code in 
your deployment process can make your developer life a whole lot easier.

Talk given at `DC Configuration Management Group <http://www.meetup.com/DC-Configuration-Management-Group/events/170471292/>`_

`Effective Software-to-User Communication </presentations/2014-neon-guild-effective-software-to-user-communication.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are many options for communicating with users. Where should you begin
when you're evaluating adding push notifications, emails, text message 
alerts, and voice calls to your application? This talk will cover when it is
appropriate and effective to use certain forms of communication as well as
how you integrate those methods into your application.

Talk given at the `Neon Guild <http://www.neonguild.org/>`_ meeting in

such as Twilio and Stripe, to create a complete product. Choosing the 
right services for your application can make or break its usefulness to 
users as well as your sanity during maintenance. This talk will show you 
how to find, evaluate, and integrate external APIs to maximize their value
in your software application.

Upcoming session at `Capital One <https://www.capitalone.com/>`_'s internal

    short talk covers several important rules for fostering maximum user 
    engagement while avoiding spamming your customers.
    Upcoming short 10 minute talk on March 3 to

`DevOps: Adoption through Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing </presentations/2014-adapt-devops.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DevOps movement is built on a real need in the software development 
community: how to rapidly deploy Agile teams' dramatically increased 
output into production. This talk will show the advent of the DevOps 
movement and provide greater understanding based on the Culture, Automation, 
Measurement and Sharing (CAMS) framework. The audience will leave this 
presentation with immediate actions to drive DevOps adoption within their 
organizations.

`How to Win Friends and Influence Hackathon Judges with Twilio </presentations/2014-codeday-dc-twilio-intro.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What is Twilio and how can you use its API to win at hackathons? Almost
any web or mobile app can be made better by integrating text messaging or
voice calling into its functionality. Twilio gives you the power to reach
the audience and judges during your demo. It's also easily integrated within 
a few minutes, which is key at time constrained events like hackathons.

Postponed due to inclement weather in D.C. on February 15. Talk was to be
presented at `CodeDay DC <http://dc.codeday.org/>`_ in the Dupont 
neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

`Making Dev + Ops Work </presentations/2014-finra-dev-plus-ops.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Getting DevOps to work in any organization is difficult because developers 
speak a different language than ops. This talk focuses on bridging the divide 
between the application developer and system administrator perspectives, 
improving infrastructure incrementally, and showing progress to skeptical 
non-technical colleagues in a 'because we've always done it that way 
environment.

Talk presented on January 22 to the 
`Financial Industry Regulatory Authority <http://www.finra.org/>`_
(FINRA) on January 22 in Rockville, Maryland.

application I built to facilitate immediate feedback from an audience 
during a presentation. The app is written in Django and easily deployable to
virtual private servers by using Ansible. Txt 2 React uses the Twilio platform 
to provision phone numbers for feedback collection through the audience's
text messages.

2013 Talks
----------

`Static Sites With Pelican </presentations/pelican-static-sites.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pelican is a Python-powered static website generator that combines
a markup language such a ReStructuredText or Markdown with Jinja2 
templates to output HTML pages. Those pages combined with CSS, images, 
JavaScript, and third party services can be hosted for free or low cost
on services such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 with CloudFront. This talk
goes over what Pelican does and how it can help you instantly scale
a static website to virtually unlimited traffic for free.

sensitive information and alerting users to take immediate action. Twilio 
makes sending Short Message Service (SMS) messages easy with a few lines of 
code. This talk walks through the Twilio service, sign up process, API,
Python library, and how to easily integrate sending text messages into a new
or existing Python application.

`DevOps Deployments-as-a-Service </presentations/dc-cont-intg-delivery-devops-service.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What are the best software-as-a-service platforms for building and deploying 
your code? How can they help you quickly get a project off the ground and 
sustain best practices as your codebase continues to scale? This talk 
answers these questions and more by introducing you to services such as 
Circle CI, Travis CI, factor.io, Code Climate, and many others, which take 
the burden off setting up the infrastructure yourself. The talk will 
balance out the discussion with the downsides to these platforms and 
ways to avoid being locked in to declining providers.

How do you quickly get up to speed on an existing Django project codebase? 
You're eventually going to run into a large unfamiliar codebase whether 
you're the new developer on a team with an established codebase 
or just working with code you wrote awhile back. This talk covers steps you 
absolutely must take to identify and triage existing issues, stablize the 
codebase, and gently guide the project towards "this is amazing!" status.

Talk given at

city size that matters), what mistakes they need to correct, and how Omaha 
can continue building momentum for its developer community.
