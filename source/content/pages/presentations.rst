2013 Talk
---------

Staying Sane While Taking Over An Existing Django Codebase 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How do you quickly get up to speed on an existing Django project codebase? 
You're eventually going to run into a large unfamiliar codebase whether 
you're the new developer on a team with an established codebase 
or just working with code you wrote awhile back. This talk covers steps you 
absolutely must take to identify and triage existing issues, stablize the 
codebase, and gently guide the project towards "this is amazing!" status.

Upcoming presentation to 
`Boston Django <http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/>`_ at the end of July.

What differentiates tech communities in cities across the United States? 
How do you make your community rally around a programming language's 
ecosystem and spur genuine excitement every time your group meets? This 
talk will show you what the best tech communities do right (hint: it's not 
city size that matters), what mistakes they need to correct, and how Omaha 
can continue building momentum for its developer community.

branches for testing and production deployments. This programming 
language-agnostic talk draws upon work with both co-located and 
geographically dispersed teams at the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, the George Washington University, and Motley Fool, some of which 
was recently covered in this
