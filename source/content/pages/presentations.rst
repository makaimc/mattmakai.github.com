2013 Talks
----------

`DevOps Deployments-as-a-Service </presentations/dc-cont-intg-delivery-devops-service.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What are the best software-as-a-service platforms for building and deploying 
your code? How can they help you quickly get a project off the ground and 
sustain best practices as your codebase continues to scale? This talk 
answers these questions and more by introducing you to services such as 
Circle CI, Travis CI, factor.io, Code Climate, and many others, which take 
the burden off setting up the infrastructure yourself. The talk will 
balance out the discussion with the downsides to these platforms and 
ways to avoid being locked in to declining providers.

Upcoming presentation to 
`DC Continuous Integration, Delivery, & Deployment <http://www.meetup.com/DC-continuous-integration/events/127362992/>`_ on September 25th in Arlington, VA.

`DjangoCon 2013: Making Django Play Nice With Third Party Services </presentations/djangocon-2013.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Modern Django projects combine custom apps with third party services, 
such as Twilio and Stripe, to create a complete product. Choosing the 
right services for your application can make or break its usefulness to 
users as well as your sanity during maintenance. This talk will show you 
how to properly evaluate, integrate, and maximize what you get out of 
SaaS products in your Django projects.

Talk given at `DjangoCon US <http://www.djangocon.us/schedule/>`_ on 
September 5th at 10am in Chicago, IL. There are 
`pictures of several DjangoCon speakers <http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/djangocon-2013-pictures.html>`_ 
including myself in this blog post.

`Staying Sane While Taking Over An Existing Django Codebase </presentations/django-boston-july-2013.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How do you quickly get up to speed on an existing Django project codebase? 
You're eventually going to run into a large unfamiliar codebase whether 
you're the new developer on a team with an established codebase 
or just working with code you wrote awhile back. This talk covers steps you 
absolutely must take to identify and triage existing issues, stablize the 
codebase, and gently guide the project towards "this is amazing!" status.

Talk given at 
`Boston Django <http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/100266532/>`_ 
on July 31st. There is a 
`video <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psCVC9BdgsA>`_ 
available for this talk, a 
`summary with pictures <http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/django-boston-talk.html>`_

`Making Your City's Developer Community Awesome </presentations/omaha-python-july-2013.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What differentiates tech communities in cities across the United States? 
How do you make your community rally around a programming language's 
ecosystem and spur genuine excitement every time your group meets? This 
talk will show you what the best tech communities do right (hint: it's not 
city size that matters), what mistakes they need to correct, and how Omaha 
can continue building momentum for its developer community.

Talk given at  
`Omaha Python <http://www.omahapython.org/blog/>`_ on July 1st. Unfortunately,
the audio did not come out well so the video was not published.

What are the strengths and weaknesses of using Github for varying 
development team configurations? This talk will cover topics such as 
creating a canonical repository to have development team members fork 
from, handling code reviews through pull requests, and creating separate 
branches for testing and production deployments. This programming 
language-agnostic talk draws upon work with both co-located and 
geographically dispersed teams at the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, the George Washington University, and Motley Fool, some of which 
was recently covered in this 
`article by Wired <http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/01/hack-the-government/>`_.
