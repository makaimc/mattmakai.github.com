Productivity Log
================

:category: productivity-log

What is this?
-------------
This page is a running list of the productive actions I have accomplished
each day. The productivity log is inspired by 
`Marc Andreessen's trick to feeling productive <http://pmarca-archive.posterous.com/the-pmarca-guide-to-personal-productivity>`_ as well as the 
positive results I've seen after working on my own
`learning log <../pages/learning-log.html>`_.

I'll try it for a few weeks and see if I feel like it adds value to my
life. If not, I'll cut it.
