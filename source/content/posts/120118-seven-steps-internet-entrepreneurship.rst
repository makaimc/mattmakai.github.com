The Seven Steps
===============

There are at least seven distinct steps towards Internet entrepreneurship. 
I'll begin with the caveat that these seven steps only apply in the 
Internet space and not other avenues such as starting a bakery. 
From my (limited) experience, everyone goes through these steps in 
order. Some steps take hours, while others can take years.

The seven steps are:

1. Putting something online through a platform such as Tumblr, spreading 
   the word, receiving critical feedback, and improving your work

2. Building and putting out any type of website of your own creation

3. Building a site conceived from your own idea with potential
   for monetization

4. Launching your first web application with a sign up process and 
   methods for payments

5. Getting your first paying customer, obtaining feedback, and 
   improving your product

6. Having a steady stream of customers

7. Becoming profitable, growing your customer base, and increasing 
   your product's value to your customers

By understanding these seven steps, you can assess your own position 
and determine how you can take the next step. The goal 
is not to rush through each step to get to the next one, but instead 
to learn at each milestone. Become comfortable with yourself, your 
own skills, and determine what aspects you need to improve.

For example, I created many sites with Python and Django in 2009. I 
designed, developed, and deployed them, learning a lot about 
Django's best practices and Linux system administration in the 
process. However, I realized I had (and still have to some extent) 
a deficiency in design. I knew that before I could take the next 
step towards building a site that could be monetized and feel good 
about it, I needed to learn better design and get to know more 
people who could give me honest, critical feedback on my website designs.

Once I spent several months reading, drawing, building, and 
discussing designs, I felt more comfortable that I could take the 
next step. About six months and a lot of late nights later, I 
launched `ProofDriven <https://www.proofdriven.com/>`_ with a 
reasonable design I was okay starting with that I knew I could 
improve as I grow more comfortable in this step. Eventually I 
can look ahead to the next step in the path towards Internet 
entrepreneurship.
