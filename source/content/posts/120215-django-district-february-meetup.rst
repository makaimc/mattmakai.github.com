I'll be giving a 10 minute lightning talk on updates and incompatibilities in 
the upcoming `Django 1.4 release <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/>`_. If you're interested in Python/Django and want to hear more, 
`RSVP on meetup.com <http://www.django-district.org/events/48873672/>`_. 
There will be some other great talks as well on EC2 + github integration, 
monitoring your apps with Graphite and Sentry, and Django chartit.

My impress.js slides for the talk will be posted on this site over the weekend.
