I recreated mattmakai.com earlier this year with a new theme on top of
a custom Python/Django stack I wrote. Although I liked some of the 
work I did, I just 
was not satisfied with the overall result. So I'm relaunching the blog
with the core written in Markdown and jinja2 with 
`Pelican <http://pelican.readthedocs.org/en/2.8/index.html>`_ used to
generate the static HTML pages.

I'm also 
`open sourcing <http://www.github.com/makaimc/matt-makai-static-blog>`_ 
the code and content for anyone else interested in creating their 
own Pelican-driven blog.
