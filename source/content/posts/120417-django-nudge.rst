`Django Nudge <https://github.com/cfpb/django-nudge>`_ (nudge) is an open 
source Django application written by developers at the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau. Nudge is designed to be the Django equivalent to Ramp
for WordPress.

In a nutshell, Nudge allows content creators to develop their content on
a staging server. When the content is ready to go to production, Nudge
provides an admin interface for selecting only the pieces of content that
should be pushed to production. Nudge allows fine-grained control of which
content to push because not all content needs to go live at the same time.

Considering how often Django is used in media companies, I was surprised
that I could not find another project that was equivalent to Nudge.
It's completely possible that this type of app has already been written
but never open sourced.

Which brings me to another point: it's great to see the government open
source useful projects. When developers are thinking "hey this code will
actually see the light of day" there is a lot of motivation to get it
done right. Too often when I've consulted for other government
agencies so many corners are cut partially because developers know
that their project will never go to production or be open sourced.

It's also great to see the `positive press <http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/u-s-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-gets-open-source-publishes-on-github/>`_
and `recognition <http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/04/open-source-government-cfpb.html>`_ that CFPB received for being a forward-thinking government agency.

We need more of this great work coming from the government. Let's hope
other agencies take note.
