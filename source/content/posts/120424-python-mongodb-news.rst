Yesterday had a couple of interesting Python & MongoDB related posts on
`Hacker News <http://news.ycombinator.com/>`_.

The first post was on 
`scrapping websites with scrapy and storing the data in MongoDB <http://isbullsh.it/2012/04/Web-crawling-with-scrapy/>`_. The post walks through establishing
the URL patterns to crawl then shows an example of how to set up the
MongoDB mapping in a .py file.

The second post showed the results of a project to 
`recreate the Django admin interface with Twitter Bootstrap for MongoDB backends <http://thomasst.ch/mongoadmin/>`_. I've worked on several projects where
using MongoDB with Django would have been advantageous but recreating the
admin interface was a significant hurdle. It's great to see community projects
that break down these barriers.

Hopefully future Django releases can incorporate some of this work to
make it easier to work with non-relational databases when necessary.
