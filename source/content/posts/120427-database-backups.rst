Backing up your databases on a daily, or more preferrably, hourly basis is
IMPORTANT. Do not skimp on preserving your data.

You never know when an errant "drop database ..." will screw up your afternoon.
Even the fantastic developers at 
`Github are not immune <https://github.com/blog/744-today-s-outage>`_ to making
costly mistakes.

Don't tempt fate. Back up your database frequently.
