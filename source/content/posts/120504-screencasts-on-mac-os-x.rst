Screencasting on Mac OS X
=========================

I recently took a look at the range of screencasting software available
on Mac OS X for a couple of reasons. First, I want to have an easy way
of demoing software and uploading videos to Vimeo. Second, short
screencasts like the ones provided by 
`Treehouse <http://www.teamtreehouse.com/>`_ (highly recommended site
for learning programming and web design by the way), are a great way to
help others learn new technologies. For example, yesterday I helped a
coworker set up static file serving from the Django built-in server used
for development. He was really close and just needed a few lines of code
to get it working. Blog posts are good for when you're searching for a
quick fix, but a short screencast that walks you through the whole process
is great too. So those scenarios are my basic use cases for screencasting.
Also, I don't mind paying for great software since I plan to use it almost
every day.

I downloaded and tried the following options:
  1. Quicktime Pro (built into Mac OS X) - free
  2. `iShowU HD <http://www.shinywhitebox.com/ishowu-hd/>`_ - $60 (for Pro)
  3. `Screenium <http://www.syniumsoftware.com/screenium/>`_ - $40
  4. `ScreenFlow <http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/>`_ - $99

Here's what I thought of each product.

I couldn't figure out how to get Quicktime Pro to both record the screen
and my microphone at the same time. I'm sure it's possible and I read you
can just record separately and put both of them together in iMovie but
I found that onerous. Scratch this one for serious screencasting.

I really liked iShowU HD's feature for showing what you're typing on the
screen. I found it very slick and helpful to people watching the video. My
only hang up with it was that if I mistyped and was too slow in catching
myself, iShowU HD thought I was typing a separate block of text instead
of continuing with the existing line. Basically I needed to not make as
many mistakes - probably a good thing. I also liked that I could record
only a piece of the screen instead of recording the whole screen and editing
it later. The major downside to iShowU HD was that it did not have any
editing capabilities after the video was finished. I know I could use
iMovie or something like that but I prefer just staying in the program and
doing my work from there.

Speaking of editing within the program, both Screenium and ScreenFlow 
provide both recording and editing parts to the programs. This was 
very appealing to me. I played around with Screenium and subjectively I
liked parts of it but did not like others. I created a couple of 
short screencasts with Screenium and then did the same with ScreenFlow.
I felt like ScreenFlow just jived better with what I was trying to do 
and was easier to use. The difference in price did not matter to me. I
have not gone ahead and purchased ScreenFlow but I plan to within the next
few days. My recommendation is if you want screencasting software with
editing capabilities, try both Screenflow and Screenium and see which one
fits you better.

One last note: some of these products are now on the Mac App Store. I read
some pretty scathing reviews that the software did not work as well when
purchased from there. This may be becasue the software is new to the App
Store and it will get better. But do your due diligence to make sure you
do not end up with a neutered product due to the API limitations placed
on apps in the Mac OS X App Store.
