Over the weekend I finished up the 
`big data presentation </presentations/what-is-big-data.html>`_ that I am
presenting to Excella's Business Intelligence Center of Excellence this
evening at 530pm. 

I prefer my presentations minimal to keep them as an aid
to my talk (instead of reading from the slides). Therefore it may be hard
to follow unless you actually hear the talk. Nevertheless, the slides are
there and present one view of this whole "big data" concept that seems to
be hyped up everywhere now.
