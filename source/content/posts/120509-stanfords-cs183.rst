`Stanford's CS183 class with Peter Thiel <http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup>`_ is simply amazing. A *huge* thank you to Blake Masters
for writing up summaries of each class. Every class notes post I have read
has been amazingly insightful. I highly recommend checking it out if you
are interested in how technology is shaping the world and learning about
entrepreneurship from some of the major Silicon Valley investors.
