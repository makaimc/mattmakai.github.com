The Seven Most Important Principles I've Learned About Design
=============================================================

1. CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity) Matters

2. Use similar style serif and sans serif fonts together
Serif is better for blocks of text, while sans serif is perfect for
headings.

3. `Bootstrapping Design <http://www.bootstrappingdesign.com/>`_ is a
   fantastic book for learning design.
