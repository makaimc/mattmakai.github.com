RFP Bullshit

Request For Proposals (RFPs) in the government are so heavily tilted towards
`big <http://www.boozallen.com/>`_
`lumbering <http://www.lockheedmartin.com/>`_
`companies <http://www.saic.com/>`_\* that government uses a 
"small business only" category to get companies with less than $25 million
in revenue into the bidding process.

In an RFP, you generally lay out your recommended approach to solving 
the problem(s) the agency states it has. You then show how you've solved
similar problems in the past by embellishing your accomplishments. This is
where the RFP process is bullshit. The government should ask for all the
similar ways in which you've *screwed up* in the past. That would balance
out the fact that most of the companies have messed things up so badly,
(`for example, Sentinel <http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/fbi-puts-sentinel-hold/2010-03-21>`_) that they don't actually have more experiences 
solving the problem than most small businesses.

Of course this doesn't really solve the problem because large firms have
plenty more advantages, such as connections, money, name recognition, etc,
but it seems like stating your failures with the successes in the RFP 
would be a nice change to the process.

\* These are just a sample of the massive corporations I'm talking about.
Also I used to work for Booz Allen so I am not exempt from this rant.
