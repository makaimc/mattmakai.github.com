I found this `blog post on Curiosity's hardware and software <http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.com/2012/08/getting-25-megalines-of-code-to-behave.html>`_ to
be a fascinating read. The Curiosity rover has 2.5 million lines of C code 
running on custom radiation and extreme temperature hardened computer systems.
The author presents his view as an Erlang programmer of how the systems are
designed to be as fault-proof as possible.
