Matt Camilli and I gave a 
`talk Tuesday night </presentations/what-is-python-for-everyone.html>`_ 
introducing about 30 non-developers to the Python programming language's 
history, philosophy, and differences from other languages, as well as an 
industry analysis of companies using Python. Matt Camilli 
covered 
`how he learned Python and what great resources exist </presentations/python101.pptx>`_ out on the web for anyone looking to learn more about the language.

The topics included the 
`Zen of Python <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_, the 
`Python Software Foundation <http://www.python.org/psf/>`_, language
comparison with Excella Consulting other two primarily languages, Java 
and .NET, and advantages of Python.

Paul Graham's `The Python Paradox <http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html>`_
essay was covered. Paul's
`other essays <http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html>`_ are also
fantastic, especially 
`Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule <http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html>`_, `Java's Cover <http://www.paulgraham.com/javacover.html>`_, and
`Lies We Tell Kids <http://www.paulgraham.com/lies.html>`_.

I also covered what companies are using Python, such as `Instagram <http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of>`_ and
`Google <http://techreport.com/discussions.x/16713>`_.

Thanks again to everyone who came out to learn more about Python and also
to my partner in crime, Matt Camilli.
