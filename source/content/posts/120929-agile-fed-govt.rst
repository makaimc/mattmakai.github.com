Yesterday I presented at the `2012 PMI Project Management Symposium <http://www.pmiwdc.org/2012/09/project-management-symposium>`_ in at the Crystal City
Hyatt in Arlington, Virginia. My `slides for the talk </presentations/agile-software-development-in-federal-government.html>`_ are posted and the source code
is `available on Github <https://github.com/makaimc/mattmakai.github.com/blob/gh-pages/source/static-html/presentations/agile-software-development-in-federal-government.html>`_. 
It's a decent example of `impress.js <http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js>`_ 
although I still need to invest more time into the framework to put together
a really impressive talk.

I'm thinking the combination of impress.js + d3.js could create a really
amazing data visualization heavy presentation (with the right theme and
content of course).

Thanks to everyone who came out to my talk. I'm not a project manager so
it was somewhat intimidating talking to a large group of people who all
had at least several more years of experience than me. I hope everyone
who went got some value out of it and took away the key themes - there are
certain actions (elaborated on in the presentation) that the best 
project managers do constantly that make projects much more likely to succeed.
