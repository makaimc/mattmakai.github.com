Wise words from Elon Musk. While process can sometimes allow for a 
repeatable way to perform an action, it is also often a substitute for
thinking creatively. That type of situation leads to an innovation vacuum 
where workers do a task in the same way "it's always been done" without
determining whether the task actually adds value to the organization. Musk's
original quote:

  The problem is that at a lot of big companies, process becomes a 
  substitute for thinking. You’re encouraged to behave like a little 
  gear in a complex machine. Frankly, it allows you to keep people who 
  aren’t that smart, who aren’t that creative.
