How I Feel While Reading Open Source Projects
=============================================

My New Year's resolution for 2013 is to read code from 
`awesome <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ 
`open <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`_ 
`source <http://gunicorn.org/>`_
projects each day. I don't like waiting for New Year's Day to start a 
good idea so I've already begun reading Flask's source code.

It's enlightening to read great code although the "downside" (due to my
lack of free time) is that it is
motivating me to figure out something I can write to give back to the 
community. On the lighter side, 
`this is how I feel <http://i.qkme.me/3s3myj.jpg>`_ while I am reading 
all the great open source Python projects out there.
