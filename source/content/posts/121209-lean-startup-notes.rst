I recently finished reading `The Lean Startup <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307887898&linkCode=as2&tag=minimneeds-20>`_ by Eric Ries. This blog post contains
some brief notes on the book. I'll have more to say at a later time.

Primary concepts
----------------

1. Neither the traditional management approach nor the "just do it" without
   a plan school of thought are effective ways of maximizing the chances for
   success in creating a new venture

2. Small batch sizes reduce waste by minimizing effort spent creating
   unwanted features. Small batches are also crucial to obtaining 
   constant feedback by customers

3. Learning should be the initial measure of progress for highly 
   uncertain ventures such as new start up companies

4. Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) drive the Build-Measure-Learn feedback 
   loop through constant iterations based partially on customer feedback 
   and driven by the founder's vision

Other thoughts I picked up along the way are below.

Validated Learning
------------------
Validated learning is "the process of demonstrating empirically that a
team has discovered valuable truths about a startup's present and
future business prospects." Part of the motivation behind measuring progress
with validated learning is to get away from the idea that following a
predefined plan will work. Predefined plans do not work because they
do not take embed customers' feedback as a critical driver of the development
process for a new product or service.

The Eric Ries' proposed model is based on explicitly declaring hypotheses
that underlie a potential business model and then determining what 
measurements prove or disprove each hypothesis. Eric discusses how this
process called *validated learning* should work to avoid subjective arguments 
that are superficially supported by *vanity metrics*.


Cross-functional teams and MVPs
-------------------------------
Cross-functional teams are necessary (as opposed to organization by 
traditional functional departments) for MVPs because feedback cycle times' 
speed is dependent upon the team working together in multiple roles. 
Communication overhead and bureaucracy are minimized in cross-functional 
teams that work well together. Some people are not suited for this type of 
work, for example someone that just wants to work on a single aspect of 
work (such as programming) 100% of the time.

There's more to this but these are just some of my initial thoughts as I
dive deeper into the Lean Startup and Customer Development philosophies.

Startup Definition
------------------
Eric defines a startup as "a human institution designed to create a new
product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty." I like this
definition although "extreme" sounds vague to me, but at the current time
I'm not sure exactly how I would improve upon the definition.

SXSW 2012 Video
---------------
In `this video of Eric Ries at SXSW <http://www.udemy.com/lean-startup-sxsw-2012-videos-and-presentations/>`_ he discusses that Lean Startup is a process
for helping execute a founders' vision - it does not tell you what to build
but instead helps you get feedback so your vision creates a product that
provides value to customers.
