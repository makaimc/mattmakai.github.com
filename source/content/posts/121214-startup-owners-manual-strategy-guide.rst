`The Startup Owner's Manual Strategy Guide <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009UMTMKS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009UMTMKS&linkCode=as2&tag=minimneeds-20>`_ 
by Steve Blank and Bob Dorf describes the Customer Development methodology 
that can be used by startups to search for a business model. The 
Customer Development model was developed because existing tools and 
strategies for established companies are designed for measuring 
execution of an *existing* business model but are wasteful when 
attempting to measure the search process for an unknown business model.


Customer Development Versus Product Development
-----------------------------------------------
Traditional product development in an established company follows a 
predictable waterfall process because the customers are already known. 
However, a startup is defined as "a temporary organization in search of a 
scalable, repeatable, profitable business model" and therefore does not 
yet know who its customers are. 

Therefore startups must search for their business model and customers 
through the Customer Development process. Traditional product development 
models are not suited to finding and obtaining customer feedback because 
*there is no existing product on which customers can base their feedback*.

Therefore at first a quick low-fidelity minimum viable product must be
created to obtain initial customer feedback. Customer feedback is used
by the founders to validate hypotheses in their business model. Later, 
a high-fidelity minimum viable product is used for customer validation.


Nine Mistakes About New Product Introductions
---------------------------------------------
The authors outline nine common flawed assumptions about product introduction
when both the customer and business model are unknown.

1. "I Know What the Customer Wants"

2. "I Know What Features to Build"

3. Focus on Launch Date

4. Emphasis on Execution Instead of Learning and Iteration

5. Presuming No Trial and No Errors

6. Traditional Job Titles

7. Sales and Marketing Execute to a Plan

8. Premature Scaling on Presumption of Success

9. Management by Crisis

Examples of each and analysis of where these go wrong in a startup are
given. The gist is, you don't know your customers until you get out of the
building (the authors use this term frequently) and start showing them
something tangible.


Customer Development
--------------------
Customer development is the process used by a startup to *search* for a
repeatable business model. An important quote from the book:

  Search versus execution is what differentiates a new venture from an
  existing business unit.

Agile development combines with customer development in a software-based
business to organize and implement the business model search process.

The first step in customer development is *customer discovery*. Customer 
discovery is the process for transforming founders' vision into
a series of the most important testable business model hypotheses.

The second step in customer development is *customer validation*. Customer
validation tests whether the business model is repeatable and scalable.

A primary feature of the customer development process is that there are
**no** functional departments until the business model is proven and moves
into execution mode. Everything done during customer development is done
by a cross-functional team working together to search for the business model.

Customer Creation and Company-Building
--------------------------------------
Once customer discovery and customer validation are proven, the company
moves into execution mode (*customer creation*) then *company-building*.

Customer discovery and customer validation are explained with great
detail by the authors. I will elaborate further in a later post that
crosses lessons learned from both  
`The Lean Startup <../lean-startup-notes.html>`_ and The Startup Owner's 
Manual Strategy Guide.
