I have never before been done a retrospective on what I learned in software 
development over an entire year. But here goes.

2012 

Languages
---------
I spent most of the year programming in Python and JavaScript, with a touch 
of Objective-C, Java, and Clojure.

Projects

Blogging
--------
I moved from my `original Tumblr blog <http://www.mmakai.com/>`_ to a
statically generated `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/>`_.
