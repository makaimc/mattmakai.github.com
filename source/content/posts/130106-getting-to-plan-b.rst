`Getting to Plan B <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OC07HQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=minimneeds-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004OC07HQ>`_ 
by John Mullins and Randy Komisar is a book about transitioning from an
initial idea, your "Plan A", to a subsequent idea, "Plan B through Z", 
with a better product/market fit.

The authors introduce several key terms that are used throughout the book, 
including *analogs*, *antilogs*, *leaps of faith*. The use of 
*dashboards* is also a key concept and many examples in each chapter 
are used to demonstrate their value.


Analogs and Antilogs
--------------------
Analogs are examples of companies, in the same industry you seek to do 
business or a different industry, that have key similarities between how
they do business and your prospective business model. Antilogs are the 
opposite - what you do not want to replicate from other organizations. The 
mixture of analogs and antilogs helps to define your business model.

Analogs and antilogs are intended to produce a basic level of evidence
that the way you plan to execute your business has already been proven by
other currently operating businesses.


Leaps of Faith and Dashboards
-----------------------------
Aspects of a business that are not "proven" by analogs and antilogs are 
leaps of faith. Leaps of faith are hypotheses that must be proven if the
business is to work properly. Dashboards are used to constantly monitor
the leaps of faith. Leaps of faith change from high-level to granular 
through multiple iterations of dashboarding and modifying the business
based on the results achieved (or not achieved).

One of the major concepts hammered home by the book is to test and dashboard
the most fundamental hypotheses about your business model first. If you and
your co-founders are wrong about a key hypothesis in your business model
then smaller assumptions will not matter. Test the biggest questions first,
prove them out, then evolve your dashboard to cover the more granular
assumptions.


Business Model
--------------
Six chapters are devoted to understanding your business model in pieces 
and then how they fit together. Figuring out if there is a way to run 
your business differently than industry incumbents can lead to a sustainable
competitive advantage because it is usually difficult for existing 
businesses to change parts of their established business model. The five 
models that Getting to Plan B covers are:

1. Revenue

2. Gross margin

3. Operating

4. Working capital

5. Investment


Takeaway
--------
The book provides a solid bridge between entrepreneurship and "traditional"
business concepts that would be taught in an MBA program. The examples were
interesting and drove home each of the concepts. It would have been a good 
idea to include examples of business model failures. For example, where
did changing the gross margin model in an established industry turn out to
be a really bad idea and why?

Overall Getting to Plan B is a good supplement to books like the 
`Lean Startup <../lean-startup-notes.html>`_ and 
`The Startup Owner's Manual Strategy Guide <../startup-owners-manual-strategy-guide.html>`_. This book provides a different perspective that is not
seen in those two books or similar Lean Startup resources.
