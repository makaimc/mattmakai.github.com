Coding Across America
=====================

In two weeks I get on the road to begin my primary 2013 project:
`Coding Across America <http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/>`_. This is
a large undertaking. I travel for five months from March until August to
thirty cities across the United States.

I am going to be developing software for my existing clients for at least 
the first couple of months of my trip. Plans are still fluid but it looks
like I'll be developing for about 25 hours a week. That work plus my side
projects should keep my Python skills from going soft.

My blogging here on this site will likely languish (as it has since early in
January) because I will be writing so frequently for Coding Across America.
I will continue to update this blog with occasional technical posts and
`my presentations <../pages/presentations.html>`_. 

I currently have two future tech talks scheduled. I will be speaking 
to the George Washington University Computer Science department about 
"real world" Python development. At the end of March I still plan to 
speak at Memphis Python. I need to circle back with them about which of 
the two topics I suggested are more useful to their audience. Otherwise
I hope to keep the speaking engagements to a minimum while I am on the
road. Listening, asking questions, and synthesizing information through
writing are my priorities.
