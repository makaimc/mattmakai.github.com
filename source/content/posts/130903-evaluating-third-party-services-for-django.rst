Every non-trivial modern Django project combines externally hosted third 
party services with custom code to create a complete web application. The
art of discovering, evaluating, integrating, and maintaining these third
party services is an important capability for any Django developer. This
is the second of four blog posts, following my
`discovering third party services post </identifying-third-party-services-for-django.html>`_.



If you're going to DjangoCon this year, come see my talk on 
`Making Django Play Nice With Third Party Services <http://www.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/47/>`_ 
on September 5 at 10am.
