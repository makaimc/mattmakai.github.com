Getting Started With Pelican and GitHub Pages
=============================================

Pelican is an open source static website generator. While Pelican is written
in Python, you don't have to know much about that programming language to get 
started. In this post, I'll walk through the steps to getting your first 
Pelican website up and running, including a deployment to GitHub Pages for 
hosting.

A quick note before we dive in. I've been using Pelican for about 
two and a half years. I currently have three live sites 
deployed, and the code to each one is on GitHub. Those repositories are 
`this blog <https://github.com/makaimc/mattmakai.github.com>`_, 
`my Coding Across America project <https://github.com/makaimc/codingacrossamerica.github.com>`_, 
and 
`the Full Stack Python walkthrough <https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com>`_.
I can't guarantee that each one uses Pelican version 3.3+ best practices, but
each one does exactly what I want it to do: get out of my way so I can
write and publish.

I'm assuming you're working with Mac OS X or Linux for this tutorial. I
used Cygwin on Windows a couple of years ago to get some of this working so
that may be an option if you're operating system limited.

Kickstart Example Project
-------------------------
Let's use the Full Stack Python code to get up and running within just a
few steps.

First, grab the code and put it in a directory named "fsp"::

    git clone git@github.com:makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com fsp

We can already get the website working since it's already been generated in
its current state by Pelican when I checked it in. Go to the "fsp" directory
and use the built-in Python HTTP server::

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Full Stack Python is now running on port 8000. Go to http://localhost:8000/ 
in your browser and you'll see the same site that's currently on 
fullstackpython.com. Note if you want to run more than one site at a time
you can add a port number after "SimpleHTTPServer" to serve on a different 
port.

Now we need to install the dependencies to make changes to the site and
regenerate the output. This step is the one part that takes a little more 
Python knowledge. We need to use `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ 
to install Pelican, but first we need to make sure pip is installed. 
On Mac OS X's console::

    sudo easy_install pip

On the Ubuntu command line::

    sudo apt-get install python-pip

If you're not familiar with Python, you'll also want to look at 
`virtualenv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ to isolate Pelican's
dependencies. This will be important if you have more than one Pelican-using
project and they are on different versions of Pelican. Python developers can 
just nod and move along here.

Full Stack Python's dependencies are stored in the 
fsp/source/requirements.txt file. Go to that directory and install Pelican::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

That will fail if you're not using a virtualenv because you're trying to
install these requirements into your base Python installation. If you don't 
want to use virtualenv at this point just put a "sudo" in front of the 
command.

We're ready to make a change now. Go to the fsp/source/content/pages/ 
directory and modify one of the files. For example, add another
entry in change-log.rst then save the file.

Pelican needs to regenerate the website output before you can see the results
in your browser. I've wrapped those changes in a Makefile stored in 
fsp/source/. Rather than explaining make here, let's just execute the commands
manually that we need to regenerate the website::
    
    mkdir ./output
    mkdir ./output/static/
    cp -R theme/static/css theme/static/js theme/static/img output/
    cp -R theme/static/lib theme/static/plugin output/
    cp -R static-html/* output/static/
    pelican -t theme -s settings.py content
    cp -R output/* ..
    rm -rf output/

What's all that? Basically we're just:

* creating a couple of output directories
* copying static files that Pelican doesn't touch (like CSS, JavaScript,
  and images) into our output directory
* regenerating the website HTML output with Pelican
* copying all of the output to the parent directory of fsp/source
* deleting the output directory

I wrap those commands in a Makefile to automate the execution of those 
commands. Note that there's a bunch of ways to make this build process more
efficient. But once I got everything working I focused on writing and 
publishing. You should figure out what setup will work best for your goals.

Now the website is regenerated and you should see the changes in your 
browser when you refresh the page.

GitHub Pages
------------
GitHub Pages is an easy and free way to host static websites. You just
need to have a branch called "gh-pages" in your repository, then go into
the application's settings through GitHub's user interface and enable
GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages settings through the user interface on their web application.

Fork the Full Stack Python repository or create a new repository with a
gh-pages branch. Enable GitHub Pages under the application settings. Then
you should be able to access your static website at [repo name].github.io.

One last note. You can point your host records for your DNS settings of a
domain you own to 204.232.175.78 so the site will be accessible through
your domain name. I use Namecheap as my domain name registrar so my host
records for @ and www look like this:

.. image:: ../img/host-records-github-pages.jpg
  :alt: Namecheap host records for fullstackpython.com

Namecheap host records pointing to GitHub Pages IP address for 
fullstackpython.com.

That's all for now! You'll definitely want to check out the

next for a thorough walkthrough of setting up your own new project.
