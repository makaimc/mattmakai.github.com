  <h2>Steps for Non-Developers to Start an Internet Business</h2>
  
  
    <div class="blog-content">
  <p>I am often asked by friends and colleagues about what first steps
a non-technical person should take when they come up with ideas and want to
do something with them. I always appreciate these requests since it
provides recognition that I have some insight into software development
in the entrepreneurship and small business space. This is my first attempt to
describe in a blog post what I tell non-developers who ask me for advice.</p>
<div class="section" id="outline">
<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>There's an overwhelming amount of information in the areas of
entrepreneurship and software development. This post is one perspective for
an outline of what you need to know. The goal is to point you in the right
direction so you don't become demotivated while reading endless information.</p>
<p>The five-part outline described in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JXXKR4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004JXXKR4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=minimneeds-20">The Personal MBA</a> (highly recommended read)
provides an initial framework for understanding what you need to know about
business. I'll use these five parts to describe what to learn:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Value Creation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Marketing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sales</strong></li>
<li><strong>Value Delivery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Finance</strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="value-creation">
<h2>Value Creation</h2>
<p>When someone has an idea, they perceive value for themselves or others in the
abstract concept. But there is no way to know whether the implementation of
that idea creates actual value. This is why prototypes, such as screen mockups
using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html">minimum</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://steveblank.com/2010/03/04/perfection-by-subtraction-the-minimum-feature-set/">viable</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://johnnyholland.org/2012/02/making-sense-of-minimum-viable-products/">products</a> are important. The sooner you go from idea to even partially
implemented product, the faster you can get feedback from your target paying
customers as to whether or not your implementation provides value to them.</p>
<p>Three more concepts are important here. First, does your implementation
solve a real problem? Is the solution a &quot;nice to have&quot; or a <strong>must have now</strong>
type of product? Don Dodge <a class="reference external" href="http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2008/03/does-your-start.html">covers the &quot;vitamin or painkiller&quot; question</a>
brilliantly in that post.</p>
<p>Second, ideas aren't worth anything until they are (well) executed on.
Customers do not pay for an idea, they pay for a product or service that
solves their problem. That's not to say the idea isn't important, it just
means the idea is important <em>in combination</em> with execution. Here's what
some of the best minds in technology have to say about
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.derekflanzraich.com/2010/08/idea-or-execution/">idea versus execution</a>
and another post that takes the hard stand that
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.inc.com/rob-adams/2010/06/ideas-commodity-but-execution-intelligence-matters.html">your idea doesn't matter</a>.</p>
<p>Third, what is it going to take to get you to the point where you can talk
to potential customers? For non-developers, this means putting together
screen mock ups with a tool like Balsamiq or
<a class="reference external" href="https://gomockingbird.com/">Mockingbird</a> while <em>also learning how to code</em>.
There are many reasons for why you should
<a class="reference external" href="http://sachagreif.com/please-learn-to-code/">learn to code</a>, but it
primarily boils down to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Iterating on your working prototype faster based on customer feedback</li>
<li>Gaining an in-depth understanding your business' operations</li>
<li>Pitching in with development, especially in the early days, even if you plan to do the customer development while your co-founder builds the site</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't want to learn how to code, ask yourself if you really want to
be an entrepreneur in an Internet-based business. Entrepreneurs recognize
that sometimes you've just got to roll up your sleeves and get a job done.
(Likewise, developers must to recognize customer development, marketing,
sales, finance, etc., are <strong>really</strong> important to a business' success.)
Learning how to code needs its own detailed blog post in the future but I
subjectively recommend <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/">Python</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> as a programming language and
web application framework starting point.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="marketing">
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>Once you've created a desirable web application based on customer feedback,
marketing becomes a priority for gaining new paying customers. Your first
customers should be the people you worked with to create your product.
Hopefully they are early-adopter evangelists who are willing to both give
you testimonials to put on your website as well as spread the word to
like-minded potential customers.</p>
<p>There are several resources I have found that were tremendously helpful in
better understanding marketing. First, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615373968/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0615373968&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=minimneeds-20">Start Small, Stay Small</a> provides a
developer-centric perspective on online advertisements, search engine
optimization, and marketing. If you're already a software developer, you
should start with this book. Second, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684856360/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0684856360&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=minimneeds-20">Permission Marketing</a> is a classic marketing
book that discusses the shift from interruption marketing (stopping people
from what they are currently doing) and shifting into a permission marketing
model where potential customers identify that they have the problem you
are solving with your product or service.</p>
<p>There are a few likely options you will most commonly use to market your
product since your budget for marketing is going to be limited.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Blog posts</strong>, along with proper <a class="reference external" href="ttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043D2E7W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0043D2E7W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=minimneeds-20">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO), also known as
organic search results. These should be really high quality content blog
posts that are exactly what your target demographic would be looking for
when they have the problem your product solves.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Email lists</strong>. Targeted lists of people who are interested in the problem
space both in and around the area your product solves.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Adwords</strong>. Ads that appear next to search results in Google. For people
who are searching but do not necessarily hit your blog posts.</p>
<p>Together these three approaches help form the basis for your initial
low-budget marketing efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sales">
<h2>Sales</h2>
<p>Sales is different from marketing. Marketing is getting potential customers
to know about your product and getting them to your site. Sales is moving a
visitor to your site from a potential customer into a paying customer.</p>
<p>Sales involves concepts such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.contrast.ie/blog/designing-your-sign-up-page/">designing your sales page</a>, performing A/B optimization testing,
studying and <a class="reference external" href="http://conversionxl.com/pricing-experiments-you-might-not-know-but-can-learn-from/">trying sales experiments</a> to see if they convert more
potential customers into paying customers, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/12/20/how-to-optimize-your-sales-funnel-for-success/">tweaking your sales funnel</a>.</p>
<p>The sales funnel is an important concept and it should be baked into analytics
that are used on the site, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://mixpanel.com/">MixPanel</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kissmetrics.com/">KISSmetrics</a>,
and home-grown analytics solutions. More on analytics in a future post as
well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="value-delivery">
<h2>Value Delivery</h2>
<p>Once you've sold a product or service to a customer you must make sure it
is satisfying their needs and they feel they are getting what they paid for.
This is the customer development process continued. Value delivery involves
collecting, analyzing, and acting on data about how your customers use
your product or service. In addition, directly talking to a broad swath of
users to determine what other problems they have that can be solved with an
expansion of your business.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finance">
<h2>Finance</h2>
<p>Finance involves running a profitable and cash-flow positive business as
well as performing accounting. Software such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xero.com/">Xero</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">FreshBooks</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://quickbooksonline.intuit.com/">QuickBooks Online</a> are a boon to Internet-based businesses and
well-worth the monthly fee once the business is launched with customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="misc">
<h2>Misc</h2>
<p>There are a couple other misc notes I wanted to mention that did not directly
fall into the above categories.</p>
<p>Getting legal advice from an actual lawyer matters once you get off the
ground. Don't worry too much about it until you have momentum behind you.
I found this laywer's
<a class="reference external" href="http://thestartuplawyer.com/startup-issues/if-i-launched-a-startup">list of what he would do when starting a start up</a> to be insightful at least to
get an overview of the concepts.</p>
<p>Also, reading sources such as <a class="reference external" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/">Patrick McKenzie's blog</a>
can help to identify new subjects to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There's <strong>a lot</strong> to learn and it can be overwhelming. In some ways having
an outline is a downside because you realize how far you have to go. But it
also helps to prevent blindspots in your knowledge map of what you need
to know.</p>
<p>I'm sure I missed many areas. Message me on Twitter &#64;makaimc to let me know
what else needs to be added to this outline for non-developers as I also
work on expanding each point into its own blog post.</p>
